## üåê Documentation

### Overview of Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to standardize interactions between AI systems and tools. It simplifies the process of integrating various functionalities, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than dealing with complex interfaces.

### Components

- **Server**: The core component that listens for requests and processes them according to the MCP specifications.
- **Client**: A tool or application that sends requests to the server and receives responses.

### Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Start the server and set it up to listen for incoming requests.
2. **Request Handling**: The server processes requests based on the defined MCP structure.
3. **Response Generation**: The server sends back standardized responses to the client.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: A versatile language known for its simplicity and readability.
- **Go**: A statically typed language that is efficient and easy to deploy.
- **Rust**: A systems programming language that emphasizes safety and performance.
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code tool to manage cloud services.
